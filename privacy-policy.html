                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-3">III. Scope of the processing of personal data</h2>
                    <p>We collect and use your personal data only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services, e.g. when you register on our website or log into an existing customer account or when you order products. The collection and use of your personal data only takes place regularly with your consent. An exception applies in cases where prior consent is not possible for factual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law. The security of your personal data is a high priority for us. We therefore use technical and organisational measures to protect your data stored by us in order to effectively prevent loss or misuse by third parties. In particular, our employees who process personal data are obliged to maintain data secrecy and must comply with this. To protect your personal data, it is transmitted in encrypted form; for example, we use SSL=Secure Socket Layer for communication via your Internet browser. You can recognise this by the lock symbol that your browser displays for an SSL connection. In order to ensure the permanent protection of your data, the technical security measures are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, adapted to the state of the art. These principles also apply to companies that process and use data on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-3">IV. Purposes of processing and legal basis for processing your personal data</h2>
                    <p>We collect, process and use your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li>Establishment and fulfilment of contractual relationships</li>
                        <li>Sending newsletters</li>
                        <li>Marketing measures, e.g. for the organisation of competitions</li>
                        <li>Customer service and customer support</li>
                        <li>Provision of telemedia, e.g. for processing orders for our online range of goods and services</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="mt-4">The processing of your personal data may be based on the following legal bases:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR</strong> serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain your consent for a specific processing purpose.</li>
                        <li><strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR</strong>, insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract, e.g. when you purchase a product. The same applies to such processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of enquiries about our products or services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR</strong>, insofar as we are subject to a legal obligation that requires the processing of personal data, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d GDPR</strong> in the event that vital interests of you or another natural person require the processing of personal data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR</strong> applies on the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g. when using service providers in the context of order processing, such as shipping service providers or when carrying out statistical surveys and analyses as well as logging registration procedures. We are interested in the use of a user-friendly, appealing and secure presentation and optimisation of our website, which serves both our business interests and meets your expectations.</li>

                    <p>We process and store your personal data only for the period required to fulfil the purpose of storage or if this is provided for in laws or regulations. Your personal data will be erased or blocked once the purpose no longer applies or has been fulfilled. In the event of blocking, deletion will take place as soon as legal, statutory or contractual retention periods do not conflict with this, there is no reason to assume that deletion would impair your interests worthy of protection and deletion would not cause disproportionately high costs due to the special type of storage.</p>

                     <p class="mt-4">The collection and storage of this data is necessary for the operation of the website in order to ensure the functionality of the website and to deliver the content of our website correctly. We also use the data to optimise our website and to ensure the security of our IT systems. For this reason, the data is stored for a maximum of 7 days as a technical precaution.</p>
                     <p class="mt-4">We also use this data for the purposes of advertising, market research and the customised design of our services by creating and analysing user profiles under pseudonyms, but only if you have not exercised your right to object to this use of your data (see information on the right to object under "Your rights").</p>

                            <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Analytics uses cookies to enable us to analyse the use of our website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, your IP address will be shortened by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. The cookies stored by Google Analytics are deleted after 14 months at the latest.</p>
                             <p class="mt-2">Further information on data protection and the terms of use for Google Analytics can be found at: <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#F3FE00] hover:underline">https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#F3FE00] hover:underline">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de</a></p>

This tool enables an analysis of the loading behaviour and availability of our website and collects your IP address. Cookies are set for this purpose.

                             <p>On our website, we offer you so-called social media plugins from various social networks so that you can connect with your social media channels. These plugins are labelled with a logo or the addition "social plugin". When you visit our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the servers of the respective social network. The content of the plugin is transmitted by the social network directly to your browser and integrated into the page. Through this integration, the social network receives the information that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a profile with the social network or are not currently logged in. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted directly from your browser to a server of the social network and stored there. If you are logged into your account on one of these social networks while using our website, the social network can directly associate your visit to our website with your profile. If you interact with the social media plugin, e.g. by clicking the "Like" button or posting a comment, this information is also transmitted directly to a server of the social network and stored there.

                            <p>When you contact us by telephone, e-mail or via a contact form, the data you provide will be stored by us on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR in order to answer your questions. The contact is logged in order to be able to prove the contact in accordance with the legal requirements. Your consent is obtained for the processing of the data as part of the contact form and reference is made to this privacy policy. We delete the data collected in this context once the respective conversation with you has ended and the matter in question has been conclusively clarified.</p>

                            <p>On our website, we offer you the opportunity to register by providing personal data. The data is entered into an input mask and transmitted to us and stored. The registration serves the fulfilment of a contract or the implementation of pre-contractual measures and is therefore based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. For the conclusion and processing of contracts, we require contact details, such as name, delivery and billing address and e-mail address, as well as information on the type of payment method you have chosen, depending on the individual case. In addition, we use your data to maintain our customer database so that only accurate data is stored there. In order to avoid typing errors and to ensure that your ordered items arrive with you, we check the completeness and accuracy of your address when you enter it.</p>

                             <p>You have the option of placing your orders as a guest. If you decide in favour of this type of order, you do not have to register before placing an order. Please note that you will have to enter your details again for each subsequent order. We collect, process and use the information you provide as part of a guest order for the purpose of fulfilling the contract in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. We store the information you provide for the duration of the processing and fulfilment of your order. Your data will then be deleted unless you decide to activate your customer account within 365 days of placing your order. Data that we are required to store due to legal, statutory or contractual retention obligations will be blocked instead of deleted to prevent it from being used for other purposes.</p>

                             <p>Based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c and f GDPR, we use and store your personal data and technical information to the extent necessary to prevent or prosecute misuse or other unlawful behaviour on our website, e.g. to maintain data security in the event of attacks on our IT systems. This also takes place insofar as we are legally obliged to do so, for example due to official or court orders, and for the exercise of our rights and claims as well as for legal defence.</p>

                    <p>When passing on your personal data, we always ensure the highest possible level of security. Therefore, your data will only be passed on to carefully selected and contractually obligated service providers and partner companies. In addition, your data will only be forwarded by us to organisations that are located within the European Economic Area and are therefore subject to strict EU data protection law or that are obliged to comply with a corresponding level of protection. A transfer of data to third countries does not currently take place and is not planned.</p>

                            <p>For the operation and optimisation of our website and our services and for contract processing, various service companies work for us, e.g. for central IT services or the hosting of our website, for the payment and delivery of products or for device installation or for newsletter dispatch, to whom we pass on the data required for the fulfilment of the task (e.g. name, address). Some of these companies work for us by way of order processing and may therefore only use the data provided in accordance with our instructions. In this case, we are legally responsible for appropriate data protection precautions at the companies we commission. We therefore agree specific data security measures with these companies and monitor them regularly. In contrast to order processing, we transfer data to third parties for their own use for contract processing in the following cases:</p>

                                <li>When paying for goods to the payment service provider specified in the order. In the case of credit card payments, a transaction-based security check is carried out with the help of the payment service provider Novalnet AG or its partner EVO Payments International GmbH to prevent credit card fraud.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p class="mt-2">We do not collect or store any payment transaction information such as credit card numbers or bank details during the payment process. You only disclose these directly to the respective payment service provider.</p>

                            <p>We will also pass on your data to third parties or government agencies within the framework of existing data protection laws if we are legally obliged to do so, e.g. due to an official or court order, or if we are authorised to do so, e.g. because this is necessary for the prosecution of criminal offences or for the exercise and enforcement of our rights and claims.</p>
